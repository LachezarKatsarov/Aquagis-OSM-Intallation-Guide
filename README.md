# Aquagis OSM Intallation Guide

## 1. Connect to server

In order to start installing the OSM, first we need to connect to the server using a terminal emulator. In our case we are working with PuTTY, but you could use anything that suits your needs.

After installing our terminal emulator, we are connecting to the server using the given IP address and login information. 

## 2. Check Server OS and OS Version

    ```
